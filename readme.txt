Overview: DelTrack is an app that provides users with real-time information about the Delmar Loop Trolley's status, along with fun facts and points of interest at each stop. It uses the MapKit API to display the route and the stop pin identifiers.

Features:

Map of the Loop:
The app has a map of the loop that displays stops and trolley location
If you try to scroll out of the map it keeps you in bounds, ensuring an easier user experience
When you click on a stop, it will take you to a detailed view controller that displays details on the stop

Real-Time Trolley Tracking:
App employs a trolley location algorithm that uses coordinate data of the stops as well as the times that the trolley stops at them, and how long it stops at them
We had to account for changes in the path such as turns, curves, and switching directions

Stop Information List:
Detailed Stop Information: Each stop has a page with fun facts and points of interest
Distance from Current Location: In the list view, the stops are listed sorted by distance from the userâ€™s current location
